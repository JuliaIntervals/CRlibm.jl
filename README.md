# CRlibm.jl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dpsanders/CRlibm.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dpsanders/CRlibm.jl)

A Julia wrapper around the [`CRlibm` library](http://lipforge.ens-lyon.fr/www/crlibm/). This library provides *C*orrectly-*R*ounded mathematical functions, as described on the
library home page:


> ### `CRlibm`, an efficient and proven correctly-rounded mathematical library

> `CRlibm` is a free mathematical library (libm) which provides:
    - implementations of the double-precision C99 standard elementary functions,
    - correctly rounded in the four IEEE-754 rounding modes,
    - with a comprehensive proof of both the algorithms used and their implementation,
    - sufficiently efficient in average time, worst-case time, and memory consumption to replace existing libms transparently,

`CRlibm` is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

## Usage

Note that *the floating-point rounding mode should be set to `RoundNearest`
(the default):

```julia
julia> julia> set_rounding(Float64, RoundNearest)
0
```

The library provides correctly-rounded versions of elementary functions such as
`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `exp` and `log`. They are used as follows:


```julia
julia> cos(0.5, RoundUp)
0.8775825618903728

julia> cos(0.5, RoundDown)
0.8775825618903726

julia> cos(0.5, RoundNearest)
0.8775825618903728

julia> cos(0.5)  # built-in
0.8775825618903728

julia> exp(1.0, RoundDown)
2.718281828459045

julia> exp(1.0, RoundUp)
2.7182818284590455

julia> exp(1.0, RoundNearest)
2.718281828459045

julia> exp(1.0)  # built-in
2.718281828459045
```

## What is correct rounding?
Suppose that we ask Julia to calculate the cosine of a number:
```julia
julia> cos(0.5)
0.8775825618903728
```
using the [built-in mathematics library, OpenLibm](https://github.com/JuliaLang/openlibm).
The result is a floating-point number that is a very good approximation to the
true value. However, we do not know if the result that Julia gives is below or
above the true value, nor how far away it is.

Correctly-rounded functions **guarantee** that the result returned is *the next
largest* floating-point number, when rounding up, or *the next smallest* when
rounding down.

## Rationale for the Julia wrapper

The `CRlibm` library is state-of-the-art as regards correctly-rounded
functions of `Float64` arguments. It is required for our interval arithmetic library,
[`ValidatedNumerics`](https://github.com/dpsanders/ValidatedNumerics.jl).
Having gone to the trouble of wrapping it, it made sense to release it separately;
for example, it could be used to test the quality of the `OpenLibm` functions.

## Alternatives to `CRlibm`

As far as we are aware, the only alternative package to `CRlibm` is [`MPFR`](http://www.mpfr.org/). This provides correctly-rounded functions for
floating-point numbers of **arbitrary precision**. However, it is rather slow.

## Lacunae

`CRlibm` is missing a correctly-rounded power function (`x^y`), since the fact
that there are two arguments, instead of a single argument for functions such
as `sin`, means that correct rounding is *much* harder; see e.g. reference [1]  [here](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/jean-michel.muller/p1-Kornerup.pdf)
